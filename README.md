Агай I had to force the repository because my old repository stopped working, that is, how it happened when I was already doing the 10th commit I got errors in the code and in the process of correcting these errors I did something that is irreversible (I myself did not know how to fix it), that is, I got this error because when I was pushing to GitHub I initially pushed through file: / C: / Users / ansar / IdeaProjects / homework-7.2 / srk but then at the end of that day I forgot to write srk and just pushed through file: / C: / Users / ansar / IdeaProjects / homework-7.2 / and in the guide I got a lot of errors and I wrote this code in the terminal git push -u origin master --force
and everything was deleted although there were more than 10 commits I'm stuck, teacher (
